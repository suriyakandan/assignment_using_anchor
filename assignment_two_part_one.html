                        Bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales suddenly develops mysterious powers that transform him into the 
                        one and only Spider-Man. When he meets Peter Parker, he soon realizes that there are many others who share his special, high-flying 
                        talents. Miles must now use his newfound skills to battle the evil Kingpin, a hulking madman who can open portals to other universes 
                        and pull different versions of Spider-Man into our world.

                        "Spider-Man" centers on student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) who, after being bitten by a genetically-altered spider, gains superhuman 
                        strength and the spider-like ability to cling to any surface. He vows to use his abilities to fight crime, coming to understand the words 
                        of his beloved Uncle Ben: "With great power comes great responsibility."

                        When a failed nuclear fusion experiment results in an explosion that kills his wife, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is transformed into 
                        Dr. Octopus, a cyborg with deadly metal tentacles. Doc Ock blames Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) for the accident and seeks revenge. Meanwhile, 
                        Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, faces fading powers and self-doubt. Complicating matters are his best friend's (James Franco) hatred for 
                        Spider-Man and his true love's (Kirsten Dunst) sudden engagement to another man.

                        Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) seem to finally be on the right track in their complicated relationship, but trouble 
                        looms for the superhero and his lover. Peter's Spider-Man suit turns black and takes control of him, not only giving Peter enhanced power 
                        but also bringing out the dark side of his personality. Peter must overcome the suit's influence as two supervillains, Sandman and Venom, 
                        rise up to destroy him and all those he holds dear.

                        Abandoned by his parents and raised by an aunt and uncle, teenager Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), AKA Spider-Man, is trying to sort out 
                        who he is and exactly what his feelings are for his first crush, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). When Peter finds a mysterious briefcase that was 
                        his father's, he pursues a quest to solve his parents' disappearance. His search takes him to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors 
                        (Rhys Ifans), setting him on a collision course with Connors' alter ego, the Lizard.

                        Confident in his powers as Spider-Man, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) embraces his new role as a hero and spends time with Gwen Stacy 
                        (Emma Stone) in between protecting New York from criminals. However, his greatest battle yet is about to begin. With the emergence of 
                        Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront an enemy far more powerful than he is. And when his old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) 
                        returns, Peter comes to realize that all his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp.

                        Political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the Avengers lead to collateral damage. The new 
                        status quo deeply divides members of the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity 
                        without government interference. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sharply disagrees and supports oversight. As the debate escalates into an 
                        all-out feud, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) must pick a side.

                        Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, young Peter Parker returns home to live with his Aunt May. Under the watchful eye of mentor 
                        Tony Stark, Parker starts to embrace his newfound identity as Spider-Man. He also tries to return to his normal daily routine -- distracted 
                        by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just a friendly neighborhood superhero. Peter must soon put his powers to the test when the 
                        evil Vulture emerges to threaten everything that he holds dear.

                        a hole torn in the universe. Parker soon finds himself donning the Spider-Man suit to help Fury and fellow superhero Mysterio stop
